## Overview

This policy is divided into two sections:

* Data handling on the **BadgeForge website**

BadgeForge is provided **free of charge** and is intended for use “as is”.

By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## Data Handling on Discord

### Information Collection and Use

BadgeForge is designed to operate with **minimal data exposure**.

* The Bot **does not store user data persistently**
* Any data provided through commands (such as text, images, or configuration inputs) is processed **temporarily in volatile memory (RAM)**
* Once badge generation is completed, all related data is immediately discarded

BadgeForge does **not** maintain databases containing:

* User IDs
* Server IDs
* Message contents
* Command histories
* Logs of generated badges

### Logging

* No user content or Discord messages are logged in production
* Limited technical logs may exist **only in development environments** for debugging purposes
* Development logs are not used for analytics, profiling, or tracking users

---

## Data Handling on the BadgeForge Website

### Website Purpose

The BadgeForge website exists **solely to display project-related information**, such as documentation, examples, or usage instructions.

### Information Collection

The website:

* Does **not** collect personal information
* Does **not** use cookies
* Does **not** use local storage, cache storage, or tracking pixels
* Does **not** use analytics services
* Does **not** embed third-party tracking scripts

### Log Data

In rare cases of server or application errors, minimal technical log data may be generated automatically by hosting infrastructure (such as timestamps or error states). This data:

* Is not linked to individual users
* Is not shared with third parties
* Is used only for troubleshooting

---

## Third-Party Services

BadgeForge interacts with **Discord and its APIs** to function.

* Discord’s own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply when using the platform
* The Owner has no control over how Discord processes user data
* BadgeForge does not share data with any additional third-party services

---

## Data Security

Reasonable technical measures are taken to protect the Service, including:

* Restricted access to development and hosting environments
* Secure authentication methods for service access

Because no persistent personal data is stored, the risk surface for data exposure is intentionally minimized.

If you believe you have discovered a security issue, please report it **privately** via the Discord server.
Do **not** disclose security issues publicly before they are addressed.

---

## Data Removal

As BadgeForge does **not retain user data**, there is generally no data to request for deletion.

If you have concerns about specific interactions or believe temporary data may have been processed incorrectly, you may contact the Owner via the Discord server for clarification.

---

## Links to Other Websites

The Service may contain links to third-party websites.

BadgeForge is not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of external sites. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of any third-party services they visit.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.

Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date at the top of this document. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
